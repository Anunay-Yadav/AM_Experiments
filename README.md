# Explaining Sota Models in Argument Mining context

## About this project

### The idea:
Argument mining is a rising research area in natural language processing, the goal of which is
to extract argumentative structures from natural language texts. Such components contain a
lot of information not only limited to objective questions such as finding the location, etc., but
can also answer many subjective questions as to why someone holds this opinion. Argument
mining has already been applied in social media platforms, legal, and newspapers as a qualitative
assessment tool, providing a powerful tool for analysis to analysts without prior knowledge of
the domain.
Being such a complex task, little research is done in explaining the state-of-the-art models in
this domain. In this project, we are trying to analyze the workings of these models as to why
they behave in this way and verify it. We expect to give a combined algorithm that does the
above and presents it in an explainable and human-comprehensible format so that users without
any prior knowledge can understand the modelâ€™s inner workings and verify it according to their
respective tasks.
